# Create Analysis

Analysis function calls are prefixed with "fca\_" and object names are prefixed with "fc\_"

The fc_object that is returned by the analysis function call:

-   inherits from fc_base

-   results must use standard names and include all columns for use if analysis is exported/downloaded

-   renaming columns and dropping columns from results for display must take place in the "CreateTable" method of the fc_object - NOT in the "Results" of the fc_object

Make sure to test for:

-   Data selected by surveys only

-   Data selected by samples only

-   Data selected by both surveys and samples

-   Filters that return NO data

-   works for both grouped by survey and ungrouped analysis

    -   basic methodogy is to set surveyUid to "-1" if dataObject\$groupSurveys == FALSE

    -   may need to be careful when using "group by" as surveyUid will be dropped from data.frame but still be expected in subsequent code

Make sure to add to the list of analysis functions available in the package (found in inst folder)
