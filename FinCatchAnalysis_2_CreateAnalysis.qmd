# Create Analysis

Make sure to test for:

-   Data selected by surveys only

-   Data selected by samples only

-   Data selected by both surveys and samples

-   Filters that return NO data

-   works for both grouped by survey and ungrouped analysis

    -   basic methodogy is to set surveyUid to "-1" if dataObject\$groupSurveys == FALSE

    -   may need to be careful when using "group by" as surveyUid will be dropped from data.frame but still be expected in subsequent code
