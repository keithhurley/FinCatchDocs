If a species is found in the data and NOT in the process species list, no assumption is made that the species was consistently processed throughout the survey.\nAll species (code 0) can be included in the processed species list. The inclusion of this code carries the assumption that ALL fish collected during the survey (in ALL samples) were processed. During analysis, the processed species list will be expanded to include all species found in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant caveat: expanded to include all species in the analysis and not just in the survey. This allows the following example to work: all Omaha area surveys were analyzed for red ear population structure - but redear were only found in half the reservoirs. By expanding the processed species list by analysis data rather than grouped within survey, zero’s will be included for redear in all surveys in the analysis that have all species (code 0) in the processing list."

Instead, they need to be included in the package DESCRIPTION file.\nCreate/Modify the roxygen comments for procedure\nName/Rename function. Analysis functions are prefixed with “fca_” and the same base name as the “fc_” file.\nAll function calls require a FinCatch Data Object (fc_data) to be passed to an arguement named “myData”\nCheck that fish (or Wq) samples exist in the current dataset.\nSet grouping variables.\n\n\nTo group analysis calculations during analysis, use the dplyr verbs\n\n        group_by(across(all_of(myGroups))\n\nadd addition fields as necessary “group_by(across(all_of(myGroups), anotherFieldHere)”\n\n\nWrite analysis code\n\n\nAlways include Standard Error and Sample size (if appropriate), this allow users to calculate difference confidence intervals post hoc\nWhen including confidence intervals, include 95% and 80%\nMake sure to account for missing data in any input\n\n\nLabel values like survey, sample, species, waterbody, etc.\n\n\nLabelers exist for samples and surveys (make sure surveyUid’s are set to -1 if not grouping by survey\nHelper functions are available for coded values\n\n\nIf analysis is calculated (as opposed to raw data summations), screen out species NOT in the processing list. This is necessisary because species NOT in the list do not carry the assumption that all specimans for that species were processed.\nAttach all results to an analysis object (either base or custom). Example:\n\n    #create return object at beginning of function \n    (this allows errors and warnings to be added throughout survey)\n    op &lt;- fc_meanWeight$new()\n    op$analysisTitle = \"Mean Weight (Weighted)\"\n    op$exportName = \"MeanWeight\"\n    op$descriptionText = \"These results display weighted mean \n                          weight.

This allows for consistent use and implementation of different analysis functions by parent applications and code. A base R6 object, “fc_base”, provides all the basic functions and structure for FinCatch analysis objects. Custom objects can be created in the analysis files to allow customized output tables and plots and MUST inherit from the fc_base object.\nColumn names will often need to be altered to provided user friendly text in the outputs. In addition, sometimes valuable columns are dropped for display purposes. Both of these should be done in the analysis output object createTable functions, NOT in the analysis function itself or in the “results” property of the output object. This is to provide for consistency between analyses and is important for the download function of FinCatchRA.\nEvery effort is made to ensure tables produced by analysis objects work in both HTML (which allows more formatting options and used by FinCatchRA) and in LaTex (for PDF report generation). Basic table creation should happen by providing a “CreateTable” function. Any additional work needed for specific HTML or LaTex output should be included in overridden “CreateTableHtml” or “CreateTableLatex” functions….which otherwise just call and return the “CreateTable” function by default.\nfc_counts &lt;- R6Class(\"fc_counts\",\n                    inherit = fc_base,\n                    public = list(\n                      createTable = function(mySurveyUid, myTableNumber) {\n                          #if data was selected by samples only…all surveyUids will be blank\n                      op &lt;- NA\n\n                      thisSurveyLabel &lt;- (self$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;%                                 filter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid) %&gt;%\n                        pull(surveyLabel))[[1]]\n                        \n                      op &lt;- self$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;%\n                        filter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid) %&gt;%\n                        group_by(countSpeciesLabel, sampleLabel) %&gt;%\n                        summarise(FishCount = sum(FishCount, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n                        mutate(countGenderLabel = \"Total\") %&gt;%\n                        bind_rows(self$results[[myTableNumber]]  %&gt;%\n                        filter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid)) %&gt;%\n                        arrange(countSpeciesLabel, sampleLabel, countGenderLabel) %&gt;%\n                        select(-countSpeciesCode,-countGenderCode,-sampleUid,-surveyLabel,-surveyUid) %&gt;% \n                        spread(countGenderLabel, FishCount, fill = 0) %&gt;%\n                        relocate(\"Total\", .after = last_col()) %&gt;%\n                        gt(rowname_col = colnames(self$results[[1]])[8]) %&gt;%\n                          tab_options(\n                            row_group.background.color = self$groupHeaderBackgroundColor,\n                            summary_row.background.color = self$groupSummaryBackgroundColor\n                            ) %&gt;% \n                          tab_header(title = md(self$tableTitle),\n                                    subtitle = thisSurveyLabel) %&gt;%\n                          summary_rows(groups = TRUE,\n                                      columns = everything(),\n                                      fns = list(\"Total\" = \"sum\"),\n                                      formatter = fmt_integer,\n                                      use_seps = TRUE,\n                                      missing_text = \"\") %&gt;%\n                          self$gtTheme()\n                          \n                        return(op)\n                      }\n                    ))"
