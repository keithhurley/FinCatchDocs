The FCA package is built on top of R6 classes which provides a standard programming interface for users of the R package. Analysis functions are available for each individual analysis available and results from each analysis function returns results encapsulated in an R6 class object. All public functions in the package are prefixed with “fca_”. Package R6 objects are prefixed with “fco_”."

Instead, they need to be included in the package DESCRIPTION file.\nCreate/Modify the roxygen comments for procedure\nName/Rename function. Analysis functions are prefixed with “fca_” and the same base name as the “fc_” file.\nAll function calls require a FinCatch Data Object (fc_data) to be passed to an arguement named “myData”\nCheck that fish (or Wq) samples exist in the current dataset.\nSet grouping variables. This allows for calculations to be grouped or NOT grouped by surveys in addition to whatever other fields are needed.\nThis is determined by checking “myData$groupBySurvey”. A typical grouping block looks like:\n\n#set grouping vars to use or not use surveyUid\nif (myData$groupSurveys == TRUE) {\nmyGroups &lt;- c(\"surveyUid\", \"fishSpeciesCode\")\n} else {\nmyGroups &lt;- c(\"fishSpeciesCode\")\n}\n\nIf NOT grouped by survey, all surveyUid’s need to be set to -1 before using the survey labeler functions\nTo group analysis calculations during analysis, use the dplyr verbs\n\n“group_by(across(all_of(myGroups))”\nadd addition fields as necessary “group_by(across(all_of(myGroups), anotherFieldHere)”\n\n\n\nWrite analysis code\n\nAlways include Standard Error and Sample size (if appropriate), this allow users to calculate difference confidence intervals post hoc\nWhen including confidence intervals, include 95% and 80%\nMake sure to account for missing data in any input\n\nLabel values like survey, sample, species, waterbody, etc.\n\nLabelers exist for samples and surveys (make sure surveyUid’s are set to -1 if not grouping by survey\nHelper functions are available for coded values\n\nAttach all results to an analysis object (either base or custom)\n\n\n\n6.0.2 Create Custom Analysis R6 Object\nAll analysis results are returned using R6 objects. This allows for consistent use and implementation of different analysis functions by parent applications and code. A base R6 object, “fc_base”, provides all the basic functions and structure for FinCatch analysis objects. Custom objects can be created in the analysis files to allow customized output tables and plots and MUST inherit from the fc_base object.\nColumn names will often need to be altered to provided user friendly text in the outputs. In addition, sometimes valuable columns are dropped for display purposes. Both of these should be done in the analysis output object createTable functions, NOT in the analysis function itself or in the “results” property of the output table. This is to provide for consistency between analyses and is important for the download function of FinCatchRA.\nEvery effort is made to ensure tables produced by analysis objects work in both HTML (FinCatchRA), which allows more formatting options, and in LaTex , for PDF report generation. Basic table creation should happen by providing a “CreateTable” function. Any additional work needed for specific HTML or LaTex output should be included in overridden “CreateTableHtml” or “CreateTableLatex” functions….which otherwise just call and return the “CreateTable” function by default.\nfc_counts &lt;- R6Class(\"fc_counts\",\ninherit = fc_base,\npublic = list(\ncreateTable = function(mySurveyUid, myTableNumber) {\n#if data was selected by samples only…all surveyUids will be blank\nop &lt;- NA\nif (is.na(mySurveyUid) == TRUE) {\nthisSurveyLabel &lt;-\n(self$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;% filter(is.na(surveyUid)) %&gt;% pull(surveyLabel))[[1]]\nop &lt;- self$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;%\nfilter(is.na(surveyUid))\n} else {\nthisSurveyLabel &lt;-\n(self$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;% filter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid) %&gt;% pull(surveyLabel))[[1]]\nop &lt;-\nself$results[[myTableNumber]] %&gt;%\nfilter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid)\n}\nop &lt;- op %&gt;%\ngroup_by(countSpeciesLabel, sampleLabel) %&gt;%\nsummarise(FishCount = sum(FishCount, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\nmutate(countGenderLabel = \"Total\") %&gt;%\nbind_rows(self$results[[myTableNumber]]  %&gt;%\nfilter(surveyUid == mySurveyUid)) %&gt;%\narrange(countSpeciesLabel, sampleLabel, countGenderLabel) %&gt;%\nselect(-countSpeciesCode,-countGenderCode,-sampleUid,-surveyLabel,-surveyUid) %&gt;%\nspread(countGenderLabel, FishCount, fill = 0) %&gt;%\nrelocate(\"Total\", .after = last_col()) %&gt;%\n# #group_by(across(all_of(c$groupByVars))) %&gt;%\ngt(rowname_col = colnames(self$results[[1]])[8]) %&gt;%\ntab_options(\nrow_group.background.color = self$groupHeaderBackgroundColor,\nsummary_row.background.color = self$groupSummaryBackgroundColor,\n) %&gt;%\n#self$gt_table_options %&gt;%\ntab_header(title = md(self$tableTitle),\nsubtitle = thisSurveyLabel) %&gt;%\nsummary_rows(\ngroups = TRUE,\ncolumns = everything(),\n#length(self$results[[1]])-3),#c(3, 4, 5, 6),#, 7),\nfns = list(\"Total\" = \"sum\"),\nformatter = fmt_integer,\nuse_seps = TRUE,\nmissing_text = \"\"\n) %&gt;%\nself$gtTheme()\nreturn(op)\n}\n))"
