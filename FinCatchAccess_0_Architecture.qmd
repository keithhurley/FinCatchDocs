## Principles

By Using myData Object:

-   Only data that's needed is loaded

-   Data is cached

-   Data is only retrieved once for entire analysis string

By Using Separate Data Access Package:

-   Isolates and generalizes data access

-   Allows analysis code to use different sources of data

-   Allows different scripts to use different authentications for data access
